  ## and the destination BEING one of them. A test that runs a program cannot reach

  # no register pressure at all — a 3x3 `array[array[i 64]]`, one store, one read
  # — makes zero last-resort draws and still breaks, with nifasm refusing the
  # STORE outright: "element stride 24 is not an LDR/STR scale; use the
  # 3-operand form with a scratch register". The read of the same lvalue emits
  # the 3-operand form correctly, so the wide (64-bit) store path reaches the
  # `(at …)` without the stride-scratch reservation `emitLvalWalk` makes for the
